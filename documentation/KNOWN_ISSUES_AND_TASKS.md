# üöÄ Contributing to Salt-App-Kickstart

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Adding Useful Templates to the Templates Folder (Frontend) - Using Salt Design System:

We need contributors to help create **frontend templates** using the [Salt Design System](https://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/index). üñåÔ∏è The Salt Design System is a comprehensive set of guidelines and components to create consistent user interfaces. These templates would serve as **starting points for new applications**, ensuring that developers can quickly spin up projects with a standardized design language.

By contributing, you'll get to explore Salt‚Äôs **pre-built components** (buttons, forms, icons, etc.), ensuring the templates are **clean, responsive**, and easy to customize.

### ‚ú® Contributors will:
- Understand Salt Design System's components and their usage.
- Create various layouts and components (like login pages, dashboards) using the system.
- Optimize these templates to be **modular** and **reusable**.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Errors in Git and GitHub CLI Installation with Chocolatey:

Some users have encountered errors while installing **Git** and **GitHub CLI (gh)** via **Chocolatey**, a popular Windows package manager. üç´ The goal is to identify these **installation issues** and fix them. Common errors involve **permission issues**, broken packages, or **network-related problems**. By contributing, you'll be solving **practical, system-level issues**, allowing users to install these tools seamlessly.

### üîß Contributors will:
- Learn to **troubleshoot** Chocolatey package installations.
- Work with the **Git** and **GitHub CLI** installation processes.
- Improve the CLI setup for a **smoother user experience**.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Problems in Pushing to Custom Branches (Other than Master) on GitHub:

Some users face issues when pushing code to custom branches other than **master** or **main**, especially with **CI/CD systems**. We‚Äôre looking for contributors to investigate why these issues occur, whether due to **branch protection rules**, permission issues, or user error. You'll help create **documentation or scripts** to guide users through the process.

### üìÇ Contributors will:
- Gain a deep understanding of **GitHub branching strategies**.
- Work with **Git** and **GitHub APIs** to push code to **non-default branches**.
- Create documentation or scripts to streamline this process for users.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Adding Options to `npx salt-app-kickstart@latest` Command:

We plan to expand the functionality of the `npx salt-app-kickstart@latest` CLI tool by adding **new options**. For example, using `./` should create the app in the **current directory**, while `-y` should accept all **default prompts** without interaction, simplifying the setup for advanced users.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Contributors will:
- Modify the command-line arguments for `salt-app-kickstart`.
- Add options like `./` for creating in the same folder and `-y` for auto-accepting defaults.
- Ensure the **CLI tool** remains user-friendly while providing more flexibility.

---

## üîß Technologies Used to Solve These Problems:
- **Node.js** and **JavaScript** for the CLI tool development.
- **Salt Design System** for creating UI components and templates.
- **Chocolatey** for managing system-level software installations (Git, GitHub CLI).
- **Git** and **GitHub** for version control and branch management.
- **React** for frontend template development.
