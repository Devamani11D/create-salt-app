# Good Coding Practices

Please follow these coding standards:

1. **Follow the Project's Code Style**

   - Maintain consistency with the existing code style (indentation, spacing, comments).
   - Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
   - Keep functions short and focused on a single task.
   - Avoid hardcoding values; instead, use constants or configuration files when possible.

2. **Write Clear and Concise Comments**

   - Use comments to explain why you did something, not just what you did.
   - Avoid unnecessary comments that state the obvious.
   - Document complex logic and functions with brief explanations to help others understand your thought -process.

3. **Keep Code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**

   - Avoid duplicating code. Reuse functions, methods, and components whenever possible.
   - If you find yourself copying and pasting code, consider creating a new function or component.

4. **Write Tests**

   - Write unit tests for your functions and components.
   - Ensure your tests cover both expected outcomes and edge cases.
   - Run tests locally before making a pull request to make sure your changes don‚Äôt introduce new bugs.

5. **Code Reviews and Feedback**

   - Be open to receiving constructive feedback from other contributors.
   - Conduct code reviews for others and provide meaningful suggestions to improve the code.
   - Always refactor your code based on feedback to meet the project's standards.

# Running the Project Locally

Salt App Kickstart is a CLI tool for injecting templates into a React app, launching it locally, and pushing it to GitHub. To run it locally:

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can verify it with:
```bash
node -v
```

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/salt-app-kickstart.git
```

```bash
cd salt-app-kickstart
```

```bash
npm install
```

Run the application:

```bash

```

This will execute the CLI tool (cli.js), which will inject the templates into your React app and launch it on localhost.
